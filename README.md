# Data Cleaning
In this work, I am showing how to find all missing values in the dataset and how to filling those missing values using different method. Method explained are- Forward Fill, Backward Fill, Interpolation and Mean Value.
# Problem
(1) How to find missing values in dataset?

(2) How to remove those rows with missing values?

(3) What are the methods to fill the missing values?
# Solution
(1) Sometime we have 'NaN', 'N/a' and 'na' values in dataset. But when we check Null values it shows only NaN values. Therefore, define the missing ('NaN', 'N/a' and 'na') values.

(2) Method 1: Remove all rows which are having missing values; Method 2: Remove only that rows where entire columns have missing values.

(3) Forward Fill, Backward Fill, Interpolation and Mean Value.

# Source of Data
This sample data is taken from solar inverter, which consist of input current and input voltage reading generated from a Solar PV module string.
